          <p class="Story indent">
            Pizzora was the lands that the needy would seek, and the opportunists
            would be attracted to, a place of warmth, peace and fortune for those
            of cunning mind and quick wits. Pizzora lay on the west side of the
            continent, a great port on the aldoonian sea, its strategic location
            brought it great riches, with them the city grew and flourished.
          </p>
          <p class="Story indent">
            Pizzora was a theocratic nation, ruled by the hands of the high priest
            of pizzora, and beneath him were his acolytes who uphold the law and
            justice. The citizens of pizzora cherished the high priests and his
            church, they gather twice a week for social and religious activities,
            and many times through the year in annual festivals.
          </p>
          <p class="Story indent">
            The reign of peace and bless of pizzora, came to an abrupt halt, and
            everything changed when the Heretic armies attacked, sacking and
            setting the city ablaze. A once peaceful nation, swear a sacred vow
            to rid the world of the Heretic scum. Consumed with hatred, the once
            peaceful people of Pizzora transformed into dark, mean creatures, no
            more so, than the High priest himself.
          </p>

            <h4 class="CharTitle w-70 underlined">The high Priest Of Pizzora</h4>
            <p class="Backstory indent">
              The high priest was the ruler of Pizzora, the hand of the deity that
              governed the affairs of the lands, chosen through a religious ceremony;
              the Priest would make the Great palace of Picaira his own.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent" >
              Serving him were a group of twelve Acolytes, these acolytes upheld
              the law and attended the religious festivals. As the Priest was the
              hand, the Acolytes were the fingers that governed the land and were
              responsible for the growth and welfare of the nation.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              All this changed after the Heretic armies attacked, the High priest
              turn dark with lust for the heretics’ blood, he turned to dark powers
              to achieve his goal of terminating the Heretics in his beloved lands,
              he acquired forgotten knowledge, knowledge that was best left forgotten.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              The high priest learnt new forms of magical power that he used in
              the war against the heretics but slowly this power started to infect
              the Priest and his acolytes, twisting their beliefs and minds,
              turning them to paths of cruelty, and with this power the mighty
              city of Pizzora transformed from the paradise it was to a city
              full of horror, shadow and nightmare.

              Kurrath the mad, was born of a pristine family in the lands of Pizzora,
              he spent his youth in the streets of pizzora, in those days this was
              quite safe, he loved the city and its people, and would go around
              in his free time helping the folk out in their work.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              At the age of ten, Kurrath suffered two tragedies, the first was
              the banishment of his family to the country and the ceasing of their
              wealth by the hands of the High priest, this brought a change in the
              life style of Kurrath, as there wasn’t anyone around to talk to, and
              he missed the city.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              The second tragedy was the death of his father, where kurrath found
              his father hanging one night in the barn. Kurrath blamed the High
              priest for his father’s death, as the banishment by the priest led
              to his father taking his own life.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              Kurrath swore that one day he will bring justice to his father, and
              rid the lands of the filth of the Pizzorian church that in
              his eyes mind was suppressing its people.

              Before Tad joined the criminal life and became a pirate, he was a
              respected citizen of pizzora, he owned a inn on the western side
              of city, near the docks. His inn was respectable for an inn near
              the docks, business was good and he made lots of profit.
            </p>
            <p class="Backstory indent">
              Alas, he witnessed firsthand the severe changes to the city after
              the Heretic attacks, Tad was greatly affected by the attacks; his
              inn had caught fire and by the time the fires were extinguished
              half the inn was gone, along with his wealth. As he couldn’t run a
              inn anymore, Tad turned the ruined inn into a grimy bar at the docks.
            </p>
            <p class="Backstory indent">
              But Tad’s miseries didn’t end there, after getting into trouble some
              noble men he was forced to flee the city with a bunch of sailors,
              the captain of the ship agreed to take Tad in as a deck hands, quickly
              tad grew to know the traded as if he did all his life.
            </p>
            <p class="Backstory indent">
              After years at sea, Tad had acquired ships and crews, and was able
              to assemble an armada of pirate ships, and he set sail back to the
              lands of pizzora, seeking vengeance on those whom wronged him.

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              The referee was a student at a university called Birzeit, he is studying
              computer engineering and is in his fifth and final year. He is a social
              type, always volunteering at events and occasions, one of these
              volunteer work, was to Referee the football matches that were held
              every Tuesday and Thursday.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              At the end of such day, when all the matches were done and referees
              job was done he set off to the changing rooms to wash up. As he
              reached the changing rooms he pushed the door and the rush of wind
              from the door brought him the taste of sulphur and smell of ash.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              Entering the room the Referee caught the sound of humming in the
              back of the room, it seemed to be coming from behind one the changing
              curtains, he called out but there was no answer, so he decided to
              walk up to the curtain and open it. Behind it he found a large green
              sphere laying on the floor humming gently, the referee reached down
              and touched it, his out stretched fingers touched the surface and with
              a jolt of pain and everything went dark.
            </p>

            <p class="Backstory indent">
              The referee woke up, got up and looked around, he was not in the
              changing room, he was in side street of a city, the city was unfamiliar
              and strange, a man in strange clothes walked by, the Referee ran after
              the man and caught up to him and asked,” Where am i?, what is this Place?”,
              and the man looked at him strange and replied,
                  “Pizzora of course!, the greatest city in the lands.”.
